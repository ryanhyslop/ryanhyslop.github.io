    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Having watched by blog go a bit stale I needed something to re-invigorate my writing process.</p>

<p>My old blog was &ldquo;Powered By Wordpress&rdquo; and recently I&rsquo;ve not been working with that platform often, and find the experience when I do dip into it a bit; <em>deep breath</em> urgh.</p>

<p>Now thats not a criticism of Wordpress at all, its I find myself wanting ALL THE PLUGINS and spend time tinkering on bits that I just don&rsquo;t want to be doing (PHP mainly).</p>

<p>I discovered Jekyll a while ago and have been keeping my eye on Octopress and have decided to move over and take the plunge. With it being a static site generator I feel its perfectly suited to a fronted development blog as it lets me focus on content, markup and performance, the cornerstones of frontend development.</p>

<p>Also being able to write blog posts in Ai Writer in markdown is awesome sauce.</p>

<p>Hopefully the outcome will be me writing more and being encouraged to slowly iterate on my personal site.</p>

<p>I will try and document my progress and review my experience at a later date.</p>
